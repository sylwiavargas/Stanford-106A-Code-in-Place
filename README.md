# Stanford 106A Code in Place

This repo documents my progress with learning Python as a part of Stanford's [Code in Place](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/03/31/stanford-to-offer-free-online-cs-class-during-pandemic/).

The course took 5 weeks. Every week, we had 3 lectures, one "section" meeting and assignments.
